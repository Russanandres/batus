# batus.bat
Bat script, wich contains many useful cmd commands in one place.

Russian and english version now

## Installing and running
just run batus.bat.

## Supported systems
Fully supported all systems windows 7 and above. Half-supported windows xp. Not supported windows older than xp, but you can still try to run batus on they.
### Batus in DOS?

-No. DOS does not support user input and any simple "set /p" based menu will not work. You just won't be able to select an item from the menu) Perhaps other systems like win 3.1 or win 95(98/ME) also do not support this command, so Batus will not work in them either.

## Editing
i wrote all the code in notepad ++.

The source code is clearly open source.
